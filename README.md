# WAT

This is the main repository for WAT project in the hackathon Unchain the Frame that consists in a intelligent and reliable system to smarter consumption of energy on inhabited places that enable secure energy transactions. Here, the base code of the demo application is stored and monitored.

The demo consists in a web application that interacts with a business blockchain network and the machine learning API's provided by IBM.

## Project characteristics:
- Liberty Java hosted on IBM Bluemix
- Blockchain network configured in LinuxOne instance
- Use of IBM Machine Learning APIs on Bluemix
- Database Cloudant SQL

## Current state:
- Base project configured and deployed on Bluemix
- Use of REST interface with blokchain tested
- Machine Learning algorithms pending to be implemented

## TO DO:
- Improvement in blockchain model to cover more scenarios
- Development of user interface of Demo
- Implementation of backend logic for Demo
- Implementation of frontend logic for Demo
- Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms
