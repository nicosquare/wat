# WAT

This is the main repository for WAT project in the hackathon Unchain the Frame that consists in a intelligent and reliable system to smarter consumption of energy on inhabited places that enable secure energy transactions. Here, the base code of the demo application is stored and monitored.

The demo consists in a web application that interacts with a business blockchain network, the machine learning API's provided by IBM and IBM interaction with Docker.

## Project characteristics:
- Liberty Java hosted on IBM Bluemix
- Docker container hosted in LinuxOne instance
- Blockchain network configured in LinuxOne instance
- Use of IBM Machine Learning APIs on Bluemix
- Database Cloudant SQL

## Current state:
- All the REST request are hosted on front-end side of demo
- Business network evolved
- Machine Learning model based on an MPL model that learn which energy source to choose. 

## TO DO:
- Development of user interface for House Owner
- Development of user interface for Utility company supervisor
- Development of Machine Learning model that predicts consumption by zone
- Full integration to NoSql db
